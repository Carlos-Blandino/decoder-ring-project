# Decoder Ring Project
The Decoder Ring Project was built as a problem solving exercise in breaking down algorithms. Using JavaScript skills to resolve the complex algorithms necessary to create 3 historical cyphers. I created the ciphers for the Caesar Shift, Polybius Square and Substitution Cipher. The Decoder Ring Project also introduced the practice of Test Driven Development by writing a series of unit tests using Mocha and Chai.
